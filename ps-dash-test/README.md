<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## pSDash

The project is a Plotly Dash application focused on the perfSonar alarms generated by the [Alarms&Alerts](https://github.com/sand-ci/AlarmsAndAlerts) service.

Currently pSDash provides information about:
* Throughput issues
* High packet loss
* Firewall issues
* Bad clock configurations
* Traceroute issues
* Divergence from the usual path (based on the AS numbers)
* And more
